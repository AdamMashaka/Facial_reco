# FACE RECOGNITION ATTENDANCE SYSTEM

This is a Python-based facial recognition attendance system that uses OpenCV and the facial recognition library. The LBPH algorithm is used for face recognition.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)

1. Clone the repository.

git clone https://github.com/Godie360/Facial_Recognition_Attendace_System

2. create the image sample in order to train the model

3. Install the required libraries.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the "face_detection.py" script to detect the image.

```python
face_detection.py
```

- [Usage](#usage)

1.  Run the "face_attendance.py" script to start the facial recognition attendance system.

```python
face_attendance.py
```

2.  The system will detect and recognize faces in real-time using the LBPH algorithm.

3.  The system will automatically log the attendance of recognized faces in a CSV file named ATTENDANCE.CSV.

4.  To view the attendance report, open the "ATTENDANCE.CSV" file.
